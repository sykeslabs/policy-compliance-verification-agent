"""Chunking strategies — how a document's text is split before embedding.

This is the **Chunking** part of ingestion. It is deliberately kept as a handful
of pure functions over strings (no embedder, no database), so the logic is easy
to read, test, and swap.

Why chunking matters: an embedding model turns a piece of text into a single
vector. If you embed a whole document as one vector, that vector is an average of
many unrelated ideas, and retrieval becomes vague — a question about one
paragraph has to compete with the noise of the entire document. Splitting the
document into smaller, focused chunks gives each idea its own vector, so the
retriever can point at the exact passage that answers a query.

The tradeoff:
  - chunks too small  -> precise match, but each chunk loses surrounding context
  - chunks too large  -> lots of context, but vaguer vectors and noisier matches

`sliding_window` is the workhorse strategy. `whole_document` exists as the "no
chunking" baseline so you can observe, side by side, how much retrieval quality
depends on chunking. `hierarchical` splits structured text (e.g. Markdown) by headers,
prepending structural breadcrumbs to child chunks to preserve critical context.
